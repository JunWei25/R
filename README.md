# R
Analyzed 49654 rows and 18 columns of data using R

For the assignment, you are asked to explore the application of data analytics techniques to the dataset which is provided. You must study data problems related to the dataset, giving special consideration to the unique properties of the problem domain, and testing one or more techniques on it.

- Your analysis should be deep and in details, also it must go further than what has already been covered in this course. You must adopt the data Exploration, Manipulation, Transformation and Visualization concepts to guide you through the solution process. It is very important to explain and justify the techniques that have been chosen.

- You also may need to pre-process your data to get it into an appropriate format. The assignment should involve a number of techniques by categorize it into different criteria and a detailed exploration with the commands using in each criteria. Outline the findings, analyze them and justify correctly with an appropriate graph. Also, a supporting document is needed to reflect the graph and code using R programming concepts.

- This dataset contains the data of staffs within an organization that could determine some hidden issue in human resources management. Human resource department manager assigned you to perform analysis with the given dataset to identify hidden problem in the organization and provide meaningful insight for decision making.

- The techniques used to explore the dataset using various data exploration, manipulation, transformation, and visualization techniques which covered in the course. And as an additional feature must explore the further concepts which can improve the retrieval effects.

- The dataset provided for this assignment is related to the employeesâ€™ job information and attribution. It contains 18 columns and 49654 rows. The dataset includes the personal detail of the staff, job department, position, location, working status, and reason of termination.

**Below are some samples of the graph generated using R:**
